## Introduction

The **Streamix** is a modern, cloud-native solution that leverages a microservices architecture to deliver a scalable and high-performance streaming experience. Designed for flexibility and resilience, it divides key functionalities into dedicated services, including user management, media catalog, streaming, search, recommendations, authentication and more.

Key features of the platform include:
- **Microservices-based architecture**: Each core function is implemented as an independent service, promoting modularity, maintainability and scalability.
- **Cloud-native deployment**: Utilises containerisation and orchestration to support dynamic scaling and high availability.
- **Robust communication**: Integrates REST, gRPC and asynchronous messaging to ensure efficient and reliable inter-service communication.
- **Centralised configuration and service discovery**: Leverages Spring Cloud Config and Eureka for streamlined configuration management and dynamic service registration.

This hub repository is the starting point for understanding, deploying and maintaining the entire platform. It provides architecture diagrams, technology stack information and direct links to each microservice repository to ensure that developers and stakeholders can easily navigate and contribute to the system.


## High-Level Architecture

The platform is built on a modern, cloud-native architecture that divides key platform functionalities into dedicated microservices, each deployed within its own cluster. This modular approach allows each service to scale independently, ensures high availability, and enables rapid feature development and deployment.

The high-level architecture diagram below illustrates how frontend clients interact with the platform's core infrastructure and service clusters. Each cluster contains independent microservices with their own dedicated databases, ensuring data consistency and service autonomy.

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/architecture-diagram.png" alt="Streamix High-Level Architecture" style="max-width: 800px; width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</p>

At the heart of the architecture is the **API Gateway**, which serves as the single entry point for all client requests. It provides routing, authentication, rate-limiting and request aggregation, simplifying client interactions while abstracting the complexity of the underlying microservices.

Microservices are organised into logical clusters based on their core responsibilities. Inter-service communication uses a combination of **REST**, **gRPC** and asynchronous messaging (**Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**), ensuring efficient and reliable data exchange even under high load.

Centralised configuration management is provided via **Spring Cloud Config**, enabling consistent, environment-specific configuration across all microservices. **Eureka** acts as the service registry, supporting dynamic service discovery and load balancing.


## Service Flow Diagrams

This section presents clear, high-level flow diagrams for the platform's core clusters, including `Auth`, `Media`, and `Streaming`. These diagrams illustrate key service interactions within each domain.


### Registration Flow

  else Invalid/Expired
    Session Service-->>Client (SPA): 401/redirect to login
  end

  %% Token refresh flow
  Client (SPA)->>Session Service: Send refresh token

### Frontend
- Built as a **React** single-page application (SPA).
- Communicates with the backend via the **API Gateway**.
- Uses **HTTP-only JWT** cookies for authentication.


### Backend
- Microservices architecture with services grouped by business domain.
- **Spring Boot** for core business services.
- **Spring Cloud** provides service discovery, configuration and gateway routing.
- Polyglot persistence: each service owns its own database.


### Infrastructure
- Containerised deployments using **AWS ECS Fargate**.
- CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** for automated builds and deployments.
- Monitoring and observability with **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.


### Service Communication
- Services communicate using **REST**, **gRPC** and messaging systems (**RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**) depending on the use case and performance needs.


## Deployment

Each microservice in this platform is designed to be containerised and deployed consistently using Docker, with CI/CD pipelines for automated builds, tests and deployments.


### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Java JDK 21](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
- [Gradle 8.14](https://gradle.org/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Deployment Process

Each microservice follows a similar deployment process:
1.	**Build**: The project is containerised using Docker and tagged with a version.
2.	**Push**: The built image is pushed to the **AWS ECR** container registry.
3.	**Deploy**: The image is pulled from the registry and deployed to the **AWS ECS** environment.
4.	**Monitor**: Logs and metrics are collected for operational monitoring.

### CI/CD

- **Continuous Integration**: All commits to key branches trigger automated build and test pipelines to ensure code quality.
- **Continuous Deployment**: When changes are merged into the `prod` branch, a deploy pipeline is triggered to build, push and deploy the service.
- **Secrets Management**: GitHub Secrets and environment variables are used to manage credentials and sensitive configurations.
